        "Title": "Real-World Challenges in Pest Detection Using Deep Learning: An Investigation into Failures and Solutions",
        "Short Hypothesis": "Deep learning models for pest detection often fail to generalize in real-world agricultural settings due to data quality issues, environmental variability, and model limitations. Investigating these failures can lead to more robust solutions.",
        "Related Work": "Several studies, such as those by Agarwal et al. (2023) and Dong et al. (2024), have explored deep learning for pest detection in agriculture. These studies generally report high accuracy in controlled settings but often do not address real-world deployment challenges. Our proposal distinguishes itself by focusing on the negative outcomes and the underlying reasons behind these failures.",
        "Abstract": "Accurate pest detection is vital for protecting crops and ensuring food security. While deep learning models have shown promise in controlled environments, their performance often degrades in real-world applications. This proposal aims to investigate the reasons behind these failures. We hypothesize that data quality issues, environmental variability, and model limitations are significant factors. By conducting a series of experiments, we will explore these challenges in depth and propose robust solutions to improve the generalizability of deep learning models for pest detection. Our research will provide valuable insights for the agricultural community and contribute to the development of more reliable AI tools for precision farming.",
        "Experiments": [
            "1. **Data Quality Analysis**: Collect a diverse dataset of pest images from different agricultural environments and analyze its quality. Identify common issues such as label noise, class imbalance, and distribution shift.",
            "2. **Model Robustness Testing**: Train state-of-the-art deep learning models (e.g., YOLOv8, EfficientNetB3) on the collected dataset and evaluate their performance in controlled vs. real-world settings. Metrics: Mean Average Precision (mAP), F1 Score.",
            "3. **Environmental Variability Study**: Evaluate model performance under different environmental conditions (e.g., lighting, weather). Identify which conditions most significantly impact model accuracy.",
            "4. **Failure Mode Analysis**: Conduct a detailed analysis of misclassifications to identify common patterns and potential causes (e.g., feature overlap between pests and background).",
            "5. **Improvement Strategies**: Implement and test various strategies to mitigate identified challenges, such as data augmentation, domain adaptation, and model ensembling. Evaluate their effectiveness in improving model robustness."

        "Risk Factors and Limitations": "Potential risks include the availability and quality of real-world data, the computational demands of training and testing multiple deep learning models, and the generalizability of the findings to different types of pests and crops. Additionally, environmental factors may introduce variability that is challenging to control."
