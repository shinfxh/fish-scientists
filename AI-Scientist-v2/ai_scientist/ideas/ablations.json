        "Title": "Hyperparameter tuning and ablation studies on neural networks",
        "Short Hypothesis": "Run a set of hyperparameter tuning and ablation studies on the provided code. Some common hyperparameters to tune are learning rate, batch size, number of epochs, and number of hidden layers.",
        "Related Work": "Not necessary to refer to external work for this part.",
        "Abstract": "Ablation studies are a common practice in the ML literature. This proposal is to run a set of ablation studies on the provided code to better understand the impact of different components on the model's performance.",
        "Experiments": [
            "1. Baseline Experiments: Run the provided code (DO NOT MODIFY THE CODE HERE!) with the default hyperparameters.",
            "2. Hyperparameter Tuning: Brainstorm for a set of hyperparameters to run with. Run a set of hyperparameter tuning studies on the provided code.",
            "3. Ablation Studies: Run a set of ablation studies on the provided code to better understand the impact of different components on the model's performance. Generate a report of the hyperparameter tuning and ablation studies that have been run.",
            "3. Optimization: Optimize the provided code to improve its performance. This can be done by choosing a good set of hyperparameters. At a high level, optimize for accuracy(test accuracy and test loss), speed(training time), and memory usage(model size)."

        "Risk Factors and Limitations": [
            "1. Difficulties in finding a set of hyperparameters to run with. As there can be multiple hyperameters to tune, we naturally suffer from the curse of dimensionality. Here we run with a suitable subset of hyperparameters.",
            "2. Ablation studies can be time-consuming to run. Here we run with a suitable subset of ablation studies.",
            "3. If the provided code does not run with the default hyperparameters, the experiments will not be able to be run.",
            "4. The provided code has to be exactly replicated until the stage of coming up with the hyperparameter sweeping and ablation experiments."
