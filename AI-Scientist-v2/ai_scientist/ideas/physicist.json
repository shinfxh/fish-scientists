        "Title": "Physics Data Analysis",
        "Short Hypothesis": "Analyse the provided physics data and come up with a hypothesis about the physics of the system.",
        "Related Work": "Not necessary to refer to external work for this part.",
        "Abstract": "Scientific advancements are made through analysis of data, coming up with hypotheses, testing them and iteratively refining the scientific process. Given a set of physics data in classical mechanics, the goal is to come up with a hypothesis about the physics of the system.",
        "Experiments": [
            "1. Baseline visualizations: Load the data from /home/shinfxh/fish-scientists/AI-Scientist-v2/physics_data.csv. Visualize the data in a way that is easy to understand and interpret. Read the column labels and understand the data. If distinct trajectories are present, visualize them separately. Note that each trajectory_id represents a different motion path started with different initial conditions",
            "2. Hypothesis generation: Brainstorm for a set of hypotheses about the physics of the system. This can be relying on some known physics theory that can potentially describe the data.  In particular, begin by developing a physical theory that can describe the data. This physical theory might not be simple and might involve multiple variables. This can be from classical mechanics, quantum mechanics. You are likely required to derive some mathematical formulation in this part.",
            "3. Hypothesis testing: Validate the accuracy of different theories. This can be done by for example, evaluating the R-squared error of a model fit. It may rely on some external parameters that you have to tune. Refine the hypothesis by changing the formulation of the mathematical theory that you have.",
            "IMPORTANT: infer as much as possible from the data, either in the csv format or the visualization. For example, can initial conditions be easily obtained? Can other physical parameters like length or mass be easily deduced? After deducing as much as possible, move on to parameter sweeping.",
            "4. Iterative refinement: Refine the hypothesis by running a set of experiments. For example, this can be done by sweeping paramters for the model fit. For example, in physics, the mass and length of an object is a parameter that can be tuned to improve the model fit. In general, the R-square should be greater than 0.9. Focus on tuning parameters that are physically meaningful, such as mass or length, instead of things like the solver type or the step size.",
            "5. Report generation: Generate a report of the hypothesis testing and refinement that have been run."
        ],
        "Risk Factors and Limitations": [
            "1. The nature of the data is not known. And the task here is to infer the underlying physical laws from the data alone.",
            "2. Sometimes the exact theory cannot be given because the data is noisy, so reasonable compromises have to be made.",
            "3. The provided code has to be exactly replicated until the stage of coming up with the hypothesis testing and refinement."
